DO NOT repack or return unused portions to original containers. Withdraw only sufficient amounts for immediate use.\\n· Use only minimum quantity required.\\n· Avoid using solutions of peroxides in volatile solvents. Solvent evaporation should be controlled to avoid dangerous concentration of the peroxide.\\n. Do NOT allow oxidisers to contact iron or compounds of iron, cobalt, or copper, metal oxide salts, acids or bases.\\n. Do NOT use metal spatulas to handle oxidisers\\n. Do NOT use glass containers with screw cap lids or glass stoppers. . Store peroxides at the lowest possible temperature, consistent with their solubility and freezing point.\\n. CAUTION: Do NOT store liquids or solutions of peroxides at a temperature below that at which the oxidiser freezes or precipitates. Peroxides,\\nin particular, in this form are extremely shock and heat-sensitive. Refrigerated storage of peroxides must ONLY be in explosion-proof units.\\n· The hazards and consequences of fires and explosions during synthesis and use of oxidisers is widely recognised; spontaneous or induced decomposition may culminate in a variety of ways, ranging from moderate gassing to spontaneous ignition or explosion. The heat released from spontaneous decomposition of an energy-rich compound causes a rise in the surrounding temperature; the temperature will rise until thermal balance is established or until the material heats to decomposition,\\n· The most effective means for minimising the consequences of an accident is to limit quantities to a practical minimum. Even gram-scale explosions can be serious. Once ignited the burning of peroxides cannot be controlled and the area should be evacuated.\\n. Unless there is compelling reason to do otherwise, peroxide concentration should be limited to 10% (or less with vigorous reactants). Peroxide concentration is rarely as high as 1% in the reaction mixture of polymerisation or other free-radical reactions,\\n· Oxidisers should be added slowly and cautiously to the reaction medium. This should be completed prior to heating and with good agitation. · Addition oxidisers to the hot monomer is extremely dangerous. A violent reaction (e.g., fire or explosion) can result from inadvertent mixing of promoters (frequently used with peroxides in polymerisation systems) with full-strength oxidisers\\n· Organic peroxides are very sensitive to contamination (especially heavy-metal compounds, metal oxide salts, alkaline materials including amines, strong acids, and many varieties of dust and dirt). This can initiate rapid, uncontrolled decomposition of peroxides and possible generation of intense heat, fire or explosion The consequences of accidental contamination from returning withdrawn material to the storage container can be disastrous.\\n· When handling NEVER smoke, eat or drink.\\n· Always wash hands with soap and water after handling.\\n· Use only good occupational work practice.\\n.

Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The basic types of engineering controls are:\\nProcess controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk. Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.\\nEmployers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\\nAppropriate engineering controls\\nLocal exhaust ventilation usually required. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Supplied-air type respirator may be required in special circumstances. Correct fit is essential to ensure adequate protection. An approved self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) may be required in some situations.\\nProvide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage area. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.\\nType of Contaminant:\\nAir Speed:\\nsolvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).\\n0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min.)\\nContinued ...\\nChemwatch: 1438 Version No: 7.1\\nPage 6 of 12\\nALUMINIUM NITRATE\\nIssue Date: 09/06/2022 Print Date: 24/08/2022\\naerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)\\n0.5-1 m/s (100-200\\nf/min.)\\ndirect spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active\\ngeneration into zone of rapid air motion)\\n1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)\\ngrinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).\\n2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)\\nWithin each range the appropriate value depends on:\\nLower end of the range\\nUpper end of the range\\n1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture\\n1: Disturbing room air currents\\n2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.\\n2: Contaminants of high toxicity\\n3: Intermittent, low production.\\n3: High production, heavy use\\n4: Large hood or large air mass in motion\\n4: Small hood-local control only\\nSimple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases\\nwith the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted,\\naccordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of\\n1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations,\\nproducing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or\\nmore when extraction systems are installed or used.\\nPersonal protection\\nEye and face protection\\nChemical goggles.\\nFull face shield may be required for supplementary but never for primary protection of eyes. Contact lenses may pose a special hazard; soft contact lenses may absorb and concentrate irritants. A written policy document, describing\\nthe wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption\\nand adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in\\ntheir removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and\\nremove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in\\na clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly. [CDC NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletin 59], [AS/NZS 1336 or\\nnational equivalent]\\nSkin protection\\nSee Hand protection below\\nWear chemical protective gloves, e.g. PVC.\\nWear safety footwear or safety gumboots, e.g. Rubber\\nThe selection of suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality which vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Where the chemical is a preparation of several substances, the resistance of the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked prior to the application.\\nThe exact break through time for substances has to be obtained from the manufacturer of the protective gloves and has to be observed when making a final choice.\\nPersonal hygiene is a key element of effective hand care. Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.\\nSuitability and durability of glove type is dependent on usage. Important factors in the selection of gloves include: · frequency and duration of contact, · chemical resistance of glove material, · glove thickness and · dexterity\\nHands/feet protection\\nSelect gloves tested to a relevant standard (e.g. Europe EN 374, US F739, AS/NZS 2161.1 or national equivalent). . When prolonged or frequently repeated contact may occur, a glove with a protection class of 5 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 240 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended.\\n· When only brief contact is expected, a glove with a protection class of 3 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 60 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended.\\n· Some glove polymer types are less affected by movement and this should be taken into account when considering gloves for long-term use.\\n· Contaminated gloves should be replaced.\\nAs defined in ASTM F-739-96 in any application, gloves are rated as: · Excellent when breakthrough time > 480 min · Good when breakthrough time > 20 min\\n· Fair when breakthrough time < 20 min · Poor when glove material degrades\\nFor general applications, gloves with a thickness typically greater than 0.35 mm, are recommended. It should be emphasised that glove thickness is not necessarily a good predictor of glove resistance to a specific chemical, as the permeation efficiency of the glove will be dependent on the exact composition of the glove material. Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.\\nGlove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task. Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:\\n· Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.\\n· Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential\\nGloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended. DO NOT wear cotton or cotton-backed gloves. DO NOT wear leather gloves.

DO NOT repack or return unused portions to original containers. Withdraw only sufficient amounts for immediate use.\\n· Use only minimum quantity required.\\n· Avoid using solutions of peroxides in volatile solvents. Solvent evaporation should be controlled to avoid dangerous concentration of the peroxide.\\n. Do NOT allow oxidisers to contact iron or compounds of iron, cobalt, or copper, metal oxide salts, acids or bases.\\n. Do NOT use metal spatulas to handle oxidisers\\n. Do NOT use glass containers with screw cap lids or glass stoppers. . Store peroxides at the lowest possible temperature, consistent with their solubility and freezing point.\\n. CAUTION: Do NOT store liquids or solutions of peroxides at a temperature below that at which the oxidiser freezes or precipitates. Peroxides,\\nin particular, in this form are extremely shock and heat-sensitive. Refrigerated storage of peroxides must ONLY be in explosion-proof units.\\n· The hazards and consequences of fires and explosions during synthesis and use of oxidisers is widely recognised; spontaneous or induced decomposition may culminate in a variety of ways, ranging from moderate gassing to spontaneous ignition or explosion. The heat released from spontaneous decomposition of an energy-rich compound causes a rise in the surrounding temperature; the temperature will rise until thermal balance is established or until the material heats to decomposition,\\n· The most effective means for minimising the consequences of an accident is to limit quantities to a practical minimum. Even gram-scale explosions can be serious. Once ignited the burning of peroxides cannot be controlled and the area should be evacuated.\\n. Unless there is compelling reason to do otherwise, peroxide concentration should be limited to 10% (or less with vigorous reactants). Peroxide concentration is rarely as high as 1% in the reaction mixture of polymerisation or other free-radical reactions,\\n· Oxidisers should be added slowly and cautiously to the reaction medium. This should be completed prior to heating and with good agitation. · Addition oxidisers to the hot monomer is extremely dangerous. A violent reaction (e.g., fire or explosion) can result from inadvertent mixing of promoters (frequently used with peroxides in polymerisation systems) with full-strength oxidisers\\n· Organic peroxides are very sensitive to contamination (especially heavy-metal compounds, metal oxide salts, alkaline materials including amines, strong acids, and many varieties of dust and dirt). This can initiate rapid, uncontrolled decomposition of peroxides and possible generation of intense heat, fire or explosion The consequences of accidental contamination from returning withdrawn material to the storage container can be disastrous.\\n· When handling NEVER smoke, eat or drink.\\n· Always wash hands with soap and water after handling.\\n· Use only good occupational work practice.\\n.

Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The basic types of engineering controls are:\\nProcess controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk. Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.\\nEmployers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\\nAppropriate engineering controls\\nLocal exhaust ventilation usually required. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Supplied-air type respirator may be required in special circumstances. Correct fit is essential to ensure adequate protection. An approved self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) may be required in some situations.\\nProvide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage area. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.\\nType of Contaminant:\\nAir Speed:\\nsolvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).\\n0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min.)\\nContinued ...\\nChemwatch: 1438 Version No: 7.1\\nPage 6 of 12\\nALUMINIUM NITRATE\\nIssue Date: 09/06/2022 Print Date: 24/08/2022\\naerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)\\n0.5-1 m/s (100-200\\nf/min.)\\ndirect spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active\\ngeneration into zone of rapid air motion)\\n1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)\\ngrinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).\\n2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)\\nWithin each range the appropriate value depends on:\\nLower end of the range\\nUpper end of the range\\n1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture\\n1: Disturbing room air currents\\n2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.\\n2: Contaminants of high toxicity\\n3: Intermittent, low production.\\n3: High production, heavy use\\n4: Large hood or large air mass in motion\\n4: Small hood-local control only\\nSimple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases\\nwith the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted,\\naccordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of\\n1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations,\\nproducing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or\\nmore when extraction systems are installed or used.\\nPersonal protection\\nEye and face protection\\nChemical goggles.\\nFull face shield may be required for supplementary but never for primary protection of eyes. Contact lenses may pose a special hazard; soft contact lenses may absorb and concentrate irritants. A written policy document, describing\\nthe wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption\\nand adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in\\ntheir removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and\\nremove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in\\na clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly. [CDC NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletin 59], [AS/NZS 1336 or\\nnational equivalent]\\nSkin protection\\nSee Hand protection below\\nWear chemical protective gloves, e.g. PVC.\\nWear safety footwear or safety gumboots, e.g. Rubber\\nThe selection of suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality which vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Where the chemical is a preparation of several substances, the resistance of the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked prior to the application.\\nThe exact break through time for substances has to be obtained from the manufacturer of the protective gloves and has to be observed when making a final choice.\\nPersonal hygiene is a key element of effective hand care. Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.\\nSuitability and durability of glove type is dependent on usage. Important factors in the selection of gloves include: · frequency and duration of contact, · chemical resistance of glove material, · glove thickness and · dexterity\\nHands/feet protection\\nSelect gloves tested to a relevant standard (e.g. Europe EN 374, US F739, AS/NZS 2161.1 or national equivalent). . When prolonged or frequently repeated contact may occur, a glove with a protection class of 5 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 240 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended.\\n· When only brief contact is expected, a glove with a protection class of 3 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 60 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended.\\n· Some glove polymer types are less affected by movement and this should be taken into account when considering gloves for long-term use.\\n· Contaminated gloves should be replaced.\\nAs defined in ASTM F-739-96 in any application, gloves are rated as: · Excellent when breakthrough time > 480 min · Good when breakthrough time > 20 min\\n· Fair when breakthrough time < 20 min · Poor when glove material degrades\\nFor general applications, gloves with a thickness typically greater than 0.35 mm, are recommended. It should be emphasised that glove thickness is not necessarily a good predictor of glove resistance to a specific chemical, as the permeation efficiency of the glove will be dependent on the exact composition of the glove material. Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.\\nGlove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task. Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:\\n· Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.\\n· Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential\\nGloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended. DO NOT wear cotton or cotton-backed gloves. DO NOT wear leather gloves.

DO NOT repack or return unused portions to original containers. Withdraw only sufficient amounts for immediate use.\\n· Use only minimum quantity required.\\n· Avoid using solutions of peroxides in volatile solvents. Solvent evaporation should be controlled to avoid dangerous concentration of the peroxide.\\n. Do NOT allow oxidisers to contact iron or compounds of iron, cobalt, or copper, metal oxide salts, acids or bases.\\n. Do NOT use metal spatulas to handle oxidisers\\n. Do NOT use glass containers with screw cap lids or glass stoppers. . Store peroxides at the lowest possible temperature, consistent with their solubility and freezing point.\\n. CAUTION: Do NOT store liquids or solutions of peroxides at a temperature below that at which the oxidiser freezes or precipitates. Peroxides,\\nin particular, in this form are extremely shock and heat-sensitive. Refrigerated storage of peroxides must ONLY be in explosion-proof units.\\n· The hazards and consequences of fires and explosions during synthesis and use of oxidisers is widely recognised; spontaneous or induced decomposition may culminate in a variety of ways, ranging from moderate gassing to spontaneous ignition or explosion. The heat released from spontaneous decomposition of an energy-rich compound causes a rise in the surrounding temperature; the temperature will rise until thermal balance is established or until the material heats to decomposition,\\n· The most effective means for minimising the consequences of an accident is to limit quantities to a practical minimum. Even gram-scale explosions can be serious. Once ignited the burning of peroxides cannot be controlled and the area should be evacuated.\\n. Unless there is compelling reason to do otherwise, peroxide concentration should be limited to 10% (or less with vigorous reactants). Peroxide concentration is rarely as high as 1% in the reaction mixture of polymerisation or other free-radical reactions,\\n· Oxidisers should be added slowly and cautiously to the reaction medium. This should be completed prior to heating and with good agitation. · Addition oxidisers to the hot monomer is extremely dangerous. A violent reaction (e.g., fire or explosion) can result from inadvertent mixing of promoters (frequently used with peroxides in polymerisation systems) with full-strength oxidisers\\n· Organic peroxides are very sensitive to contamination (especially heavy-metal compounds, metal oxide salts, alkaline materials including amines, strong acids, and many varieties of dust and dirt). This can initiate rapid, uncontrolled decomposition of peroxides and possible generation of intense heat, fire or explosion The consequences of accidental contamination from returning withdrawn material to the storage container can be disastrous.\\n· When handling NEVER smoke, eat or drink.\\n· Always wash hands with soap and water after handling.\\n· Use only good occupational work practice.\\n.

Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The basic types of engineering controls are:\\nProcess controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk. Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.\\nEmployers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\\nAppropriate engineering controls\\nLocal exhaust ventilation usually required. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Supplied-air type respirator may be required in special circumstances. Correct fit is essential to ensure adequate protection. An approved self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) may be required in some situations.\\nProvide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage area. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.\\nType of Contaminant:\\nAir Speed:\\nsolvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).\\n0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min.)\\nContinued ...\\nChemwatch: 1438 Version No: 7.1\\nPage 6 of 12\\nALUMINIUM NITRATE\\nIssue Date: 09/06/2022 Print Date: 24/08/2022\\naerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)\\n0.5-1 m/s (100-200\\nf/min.)\\ndirect spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active\\ngeneration into zone of rapid air motion)\\n1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)\\ngrinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).\\n2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)\\nWithin each range the appropriate value depends on:\\nLower end of the range\\nUpper end of the range\\n1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture\\n1: Disturbing room air currents\\n2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.\\n2: Contaminants of high toxicity\\n3: Intermittent, low production.\\n3: High production, heavy use\\n4: Large hood or large air mass in motion\\n4: Small hood-local control only\\nSimple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases\\nwith the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted,\\naccordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of\\n1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations,\\nproducing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or\\nmore when extraction systems are installed or used.\\nPersonal protection\\nEye and face protection\\nChemical goggles.\\nFull face shield may be required for supplementary but never for primary protection of eyes. Contact lenses may pose a special hazard; soft contact lenses may absorb and concentrate irritants. A written policy document, describing\\nthe wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption\\nand adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in\\ntheir removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and\\nremove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in\\na clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly. [CDC NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletin 59], [AS/NZS 1336 or\\nnational equivalent]\\nSkin protection\\nSee Hand protection below\\nWear chemical protective gloves, e.g. PVC.\\nWear safety footwear or safety gumboots, e.g. Rubber\\nThe selection of suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality which vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Where the chemical is a preparation of several substances, the resistance of the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked prior to the application.\\nThe exact break through time for substances has to be obtained from the manufacturer of the protective gloves and has to be observed when making a final choice.\\nPersonal hygiene is a key element of effective hand care. Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.\\nSuitability and durability of glove type is dependent on usage. Important factors in the selection of gloves include: · frequency and duration of contact, · chemical resistance of glove material, · glove thickness and · dexterity\\nHands/feet protection\\nSelect gloves tested to a relevant standard (e.g. Europe EN 374, US F739, AS/NZS 2161.1 or national equivalent). . When prolonged or frequently repeated contact may occur, a glove with a protection class of 5 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 240 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended.\\n· When only brief contact is expected, a glove with a protection class of 3 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 60 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended.\\n· Some glove polymer types are less affected by movement and this should be taken into account when considering gloves for long-term use.\\n· Contaminated gloves should be replaced.\\nAs defined in ASTM F-739-96 in any application, gloves are rated as: · Excellent when breakthrough time > 480 min · Good when breakthrough time > 20 min\\n· Fair when breakthrough time < 20 min · Poor when glove material degrades\\nFor general applications, gloves with a thickness typically greater than 0.35 mm, are recommended. It should be emphasised that glove thickness is not necessarily a good predictor of glove resistance to a specific chemical, as the permeation efficiency of the glove will be dependent on the exact composition of the glove material. Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.\\nGlove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task. Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:\\n· Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.\\n· Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential\\nGloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended. DO NOT wear cotton or cotton-backed gloves. DO NOT wear leather gloves.

Flush skin and hair with running water (and soap if available). Seek medical attention in event of irritation.\\nInhalation\\nIf fumes, aerosols or combustion products are inhaled remove from contaminated area. Other measures are usually unnecessary.\\nIngestion\\nIF SWALLOWED, REFER FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION, WHERE POSSIBLE, WITHOUT DELAY. For advice, contact a Poisons Information Centre or a doctor. Urgent hospital treatment is likely to be needed. In the mean time, qualified first-aid personnel should treat the patient following observation and employing supportive measures as indicated by the patient's condition.\\nIf the services of a medical officer or medical doctor are readily available, the patient should be placed in his/her care and a copy of the SDS should be provided.

DO NOT repack or return unused portions to original containers. Withdraw only sufficient amounts for immediate use.\\n· Use only minimum quantity required.\\n· Avoid using solutions of peroxides in volatile solvents. Solvent evaporation should be controlled to avoid dangerous concentration of the peroxide.\\n. Do NOT allow oxidisers to contact iron or compounds of iron, cobalt, or copper, metal oxide salts, acids or bases.\\n. Do NOT use metal spatulas to handle oxidisers\\n. Do NOT use glass containers with screw cap lids or glass stoppers. . Store peroxides at the lowest possible temperature, consistent with their solubility and freezing point.\\n. CAUTION: Do NOT store liquids or solutions of peroxides at a temperature below that at which the oxidiser freezes or precipitates. Peroxides,\\nin particular, in this form are extremely shock and heat-sensitive. Refrigerated storage of peroxides must ONLY be in explosion-proof units.\\n· The hazards and consequences of fires and explosions during synthesis and use of oxidisers is widely recognised; spontaneous or induced decomposition may culminate in a variety of ways, ranging from moderate gassing to spontaneous ignition or explosion. The heat released from spontaneous decomposition of an energy-rich compound causes a rise in the surrounding temperature; the temperature will rise until thermal balance is established or until the material heats to decomposition,\\n· The most effective means for minimising the consequences of an accident is to limit quantities to a practical minimum. Even gram-scale explosions can be serious. Once ignited the burning of peroxides cannot be controlled and the area should be evacuated.\\n. Unless there is compelling reason to do otherwise, peroxide concentration should be limited to 10% (or less with vigorous reactants). Peroxide concentration is rarely as high as 1% in the reaction mixture of polymerisation or other free-radical reactions,\\n· Oxidisers should be added slowly and cautiously to the reaction medium. This should be completed prior to heating and with good agitation. · Addition oxidisers to the hot monomer is extremely dangerous. A violent reaction (e.g., fire or explosion) can result from inadvertent mixing of promoters (frequently used with peroxides in polymerisation systems) with full-strength oxidisers\\n· Organic peroxides are very sensitive to contamination (especially heavy-metal compounds, metal oxide salts, alkaline materials including amines, strong acids, and many varieties of dust and dirt). This can initiate rapid, uncontrolled decomposition of peroxides and possible generation of intense heat, fire or explosion The consequences of accidental contamination from returning withdrawn material to the storage container can be disastrous.\\n· When handling NEVER smoke, eat or drink.\\n· Always wash hands with soap and water after handling.\\n· Use only good occupational work practice.\\n.

Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The basic types of engineering controls are:\\nProcess controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk. Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use.\\nEmployers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure.\\nAppropriate engineering controls\\nLocal exhaust ventilation usually required. If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator. Correct fit is essential to obtain adequate protection. Supplied-air type respirator may be required in special circumstances. Correct fit is essential to ensure adequate protection. An approved self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) may be required in some situations.\\nProvide adequate ventilation in warehouse or closed storage area. Air contaminants generated in the workplace possess varying \"escape\" velocities which, in turn, determine the \"capture velocities\" of fresh circulating air required to effectively remove the contaminant.\\nType of Contaminant:\\nAir Speed:\\nsolvent, vapours, degreasing etc., evaporating from tank (in still air).\\n0.25-0.5 m/s (50-100 f/min.)\\nContinued ...\\nChemwatch: 1438 Version No: 7.1\\nPage 6 of 12\\nALUMINIUM NITRATE\\nIssue Date: 09/06/2022 Print Date: 24/08/2022\\naerosols, fumes from pouring operations, intermittent container filling, low speed conveyer transfers, welding, spray drift, plating acid fumes, pickling (released at low velocity into zone of active generation)\\n0.5-1 m/s (100-200\\nf/min.)\\ndirect spray, spray painting in shallow booths, drum filling, conveyer loading, crusher dusts, gas discharge (active\\ngeneration into zone of rapid air motion)\\n1-2.5 m/s (200-500 f/min.)\\ngrinding, abrasive blasting, tumbling, high speed wheel generated dusts (released at high initial velocity into zone of very high rapid air motion).\\n2.5-10 m/s (500-2000 f/min.)\\nWithin each range the appropriate value depends on:\\nLower end of the range\\nUpper end of the range\\n1: Room air currents minimal or favourable to capture\\n1: Disturbing room air currents\\n2: Contaminants of low toxicity or of nuisance value only.\\n2: Contaminants of high toxicity\\n3: Intermittent, low production.\\n3: High production, heavy use\\n4: Large hood or large air mass in motion\\n4: Small hood-local control only\\nSimple theory shows that air velocity falls rapidly with distance away from the opening of a simple extraction pipe. Velocity generally decreases\\nwith the square of distance from the extraction point (in simple cases). Therefore the air speed at the extraction point should be adjusted,\\naccordingly, after reference to distance from the contaminating source. The air velocity at the extraction fan, for example, should be a minimum of\\n1-2 m/s (200-400 f/min) for extraction of solvents generated in a tank 2 meters distant from the extraction point. Other mechanical considerations,\\nproducing performance deficits within the extraction apparatus, make it essential that theoretical air velocities are multiplied by factors of 10 or\\nmore when extraction systems are installed or used.\\nPersonal protection\\nEye and face protection\\nChemical goggles.\\nFull face shield may be required for supplementary but never for primary protection of eyes. Contact lenses may pose a special hazard; soft contact lenses may absorb and concentrate irritants. A written policy document, describing\\nthe wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption\\nand adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in\\ntheir removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and\\nremove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in\\na clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly. [CDC NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletin 59], [AS/NZS 1336 or\\nnational equivalent]\\nSkin protection\\nSee Hand protection below\\nWear chemical protective gloves, e.g. PVC.\\nWear safety footwear or safety gumboots, e.g. Rubber\\nThe selection of suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality which vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Where the chemical is a preparation of several substances, the resistance of the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked prior to the application.\\nThe exact break through time for substances has to be obtained from the manufacturer of the protective gloves and has to be observed when making a final choice.\\nPersonal hygiene is a key element of effective hand care. Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended.\\nSuitability and durability of glove type is dependent on usage. Important factors in the selection of gloves include: · frequency and duration of contact, · chemical resistance of glove material, · glove thickness and · dexterity\\nHands/feet protection\\nSelect gloves tested to a relevant standard (e.g. Europe EN 374, US F739, AS/NZS 2161.1 or national equivalent). . When prolonged or frequently repeated contact may occur, a glove with a protection class of 5 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 240 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended.\\n· When only brief contact is expected, a glove with a protection class of 3 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 60 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended.\\n· Some glove polymer types are less affected by movement and this should be taken into account when considering gloves for long-term use.\\n· Contaminated gloves should be replaced.\\nAs defined in ASTM F-739-96 in any application, gloves are rated as: · Excellent when breakthrough time > 480 min · Good when breakthrough time > 20 min\\n· Fair when breakthrough time < 20 min · Poor when glove material degrades\\nFor general applications, gloves with a thickness typically greater than 0.35 mm, are recommended. It should be emphasised that glove thickness is not necessarily a good predictor of glove resistance to a specific chemical, as the permeation efficiency of the glove will be dependent on the exact composition of the glove material. Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times.\\nGlove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task. Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example:\\n· Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of.\\n· Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential\\nGloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended. DO NOT wear cotton or cotton-backed gloves. DO NOT wear leather gloves.
